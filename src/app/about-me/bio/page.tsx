      From a young age, I've always been fascinated by the world of technology and its impact on people's lives. Choosing the Software Engineering
      course was a natural decision because it allows me to explore and enhance my skills in programming, systems analysis, and solving complex
      problems.<br></br><br></br>

      I am currently working with my parents in their food-related business, but I am in search of other opportunities. I believe I am ready to
      face new challenges and, in doing so, grow even further with them.<br></br><br></br>

      My goal is to become a qualified professional in the field of technology and contribute to the creation of innovative solutions through
      software development.
